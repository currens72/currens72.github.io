            <p>Testing drones in real-life situations can be challenging and expensive. Professionals in various fields of geographic surveying require visual and statistical data on how drone fleets respond to different phenomena, but the risks and costs associated with running actual tests can be prohibitive. As a result, many researchers in both academia and industry rely on simulations to test battery and energy usage under various conditions, as well as to assess the quality of coverage and average arrival times to interesting locations.<br><br>However, existing simulators are often custom-made and not easily adaptable for comparative studies. To address this limitation, our project aims to create a unified platform where different routing and dispatching algorithms for single drones or fleets of drones can be compared based on specific metrics, such as average or worst-case arrival times or coverage. Additionally, our project will feature a visualization tool that displays the drones' motion plan as they execute their mission over a chosen area of interest. This front-end functionality will be supported by a back-end host that generates actual data based on selected algorithms and input phenomenon-datasets.</p>
