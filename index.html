        <h2>Senior Design: Collaborative Surveillance of<br>Large Geographical Area by Fleet of Drones</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Description of Project</h3>
        <p>Testing drones in real-life situations can be challenging and expensive. Professionals in various fields of geographic surveying require visual and statistical data on how drone fleets respond to different phenomena, but the risks and costs associated with running actual tests can be prohibitive. As a result, many researchers in both academia and industry rely on simulations to test battery and energy usage under various conditions, as well as to assess the quality of coverage and average arrival times to interesting locations.<br><br>However, existing simulators are often custom-made and not easily adaptable for comparative studies. To address this limitation, our project aims to create a unified platform where different routing and dispatching algorithms for single drones or fleets of drones can be compared based on specific metrics, such as average or worst-case arrival times or coverage. Additionally, our project will feature a visualization tool that displays the drones' motion plan as they execute their mission over a chosen area of interest. This front-end functionality will be supported by a back-end host that generates actual data based on selected algorithms and input phenomenon-datasets.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;">CPRE 381: MIPS Single-Cycle Processor</h3>
        <h4 style="text-align: left;">Description</h4>
        <p>For our project, we implemented a MIPS Single-Cycle Processor using mainly structural VHDL. We started by drawing a high-level schematic of the interconnection between components, based on the skeleton code provided in the testing framework. We added the remaining high-level components we needed to support basic instructions, such as add, sub, and or. We also added any additional components and signals required by the set of instructions not included in the book's schematic, such as shifts and lui.<br><br>We created a control signals spreadsheet detailing the list of M instructions to be supported in our project alongside their binary opcodes and funct fields, if applicable. We created a separate column for each binary bit and a new column for the N control signals needed by our datapath implementation. This resulted in an N*M table where each row corresponds to the output of the control logic module for a given instruction. We implemented the control logic module using with/select statements in VHDL and created a testbench to test this module individually and show that our output matches the expected control signals.<br><br>We also implemented the fetch logic that updates the PC (i.e., the address of the next instruction to fetch from memory), supporting the different control flow-related instructions we were required to implement, such as jumps and branches. We drew a schematic of the fetch logic and created a testbench to verify its functionality.<br><br>Finally, we integrated all components and tested our MIPS Single-Cycle Processor using the automated testing framework provided. We loaded instruction and data memories with example programs and verified that our processor executed them correctly. We also debugged any issues that arose during testing and made necessary updates to our design.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;">CPRE 489: Implementation of Multipath TCP Protocol</h3>
        <h4 style="text-align: left;">Description</h4>
        <p>In this project, I implemented a simplified version of MPTCP that focuses on using multiple paths and mapping data to those paths. The objective was to establish three TCP data subflows between a client and a server, without using the options field. Instead, an additional control TCP connection was established on which the DSS was sent.<br><br>To start, I created a client program that generated 992 bytes, numbered 0 through 991, containing 16 repetitions of ASCII digits 0 through 9, characters a to z, and characters A to Z. The client established four TCP connections with the server program: one control connection and three data connections representing the TCP subflows. Once each connection was established, it was forked as a child process. The parent process communicated with the child process using pipe().<br><br>The client sent data to the three TCP subflow child processes four bytes at a time in a cyclic manner, where the first 4 bytes were sent to the first subflow, the second 4 bytes were sent to the second subflow, and so on. The client sent a DSS on the TCP control connection for each segment sent on a TCP subflow to establish data mapping to the server. The mapping used from the 992 bytes to the sequence numbers on all three connections was written to a log file.<br><br>Additionally, I implemented a server process that accepted four connections: one control connection and three TCP data subflows. The server process also forked child processes for all three data TCP subflows, and the parent process communicated with the child processes using pipes or Unix sockets. The server process accepted data from all TCP subflows and performed the inverse mapping from the subflow to global sequence numbers. The server process displayed the received 992 bytes in order on the display monitor of the machine running the server. The mapping used from the sequence numbers received on all three connections to the 992 bytes was written to a log file as well.</p>

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Cumulative Reflection</h3>
        <p>My journey as a cybersecurity engineering student at Iowa State University has been filled with challenges, growth, and valuable experiences. Looking back at my freshman year, I remember feeling both excited and intimidated by the prospect of studying cybersecurity engineering. The classes were challenging, and I often felt like I was struggling to keep up with the pace of the coursework. However, I was determined to succeed, and I quickly learned that the key to success was to be proactive, seek help when needed, and remain open to new opportunities and experiences.<br><br>In my classes, I learned how to design systems and processes, recognize, formulate, and solve engineering problems, work in a team-based environment, communicate effectively, seek knowledge beyond the classroom, and analyze complex ethical situations. These skills were invaluable in helping me navigate through my coursework and become a successful student. I learned to approach problems methodically, break them down into smaller components, and work collaboratively with my peers to find solutions. These skills also helped me to become a more effective communicator and a better problem solver, both of which are essential skills in the cybersecurity industry.<br><br>One of the things that I appreciated about the cybersecurity engineering program at Iowa State was the emphasis on external activities. I regularly watched published lectures and YouTube videos to supplement my learning and expand my knowledge beyond the classroom. I also sought help from other students and professors and used library resources and professional journals to stay up to date with the latest developments in the field. These resources proved to be invaluable in helping me to gain a deeper understanding of the complex concepts and principles that were being taught in the classroom.<br><br>During my time at Iowa State, I had the opportunity to work as a teaching assistant for a computer operating system course. This experience allowed me to apply the skills and knowledge to help other students and their understanding of course material. It also gave me the opportunity to work closely with other students and faculty members, which helped me to develop strong communication and leadership skills. Being a teaching assistant also helped me to see my classes from a different perspective and allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how to be the best student I could be.<br><br>As I progressed through my coursework, I came to appreciate how the college experience contributes to understanding the need to continuously update professional and technical skills to solve new problems. My senior design project was a culmination of all my coursework and required me to expand my knowledge and skills to complete the tasks required. It is a challenging project that requires a lot of time and effort, but it is also one of the most rewarding experiences of my time at Iowa State. The project allows me to work collaboratively with my peers and apply the skills and knowledge that I have acquired throughout my coursework to a real-world problem.<br><br>Looking back on my time at Iowa State, there are certainly things that I would do differently if I were to do it again. For instance, I would have gotten involved in more technical clubs such as ISEAGE or the hackathon club. I would have also made an effort to go out and meet more people my first year at school. However, despite these regrets, I am grateful for the experiences and opportunities that I had during my time at Iowa State. I learned valuable skills that have helped me to become a successful cybersecurity engineer, and I am excited to see where my career takes me in the future.<br><br>As my time at Iowa State comes to an end it brings a great deal of emotions to mind. During my four years here I experienced sadness, pain, elation, pure joy, laughter, and countless more feelings and emotions. But above all else I think most importantly Iowa State has taught and reminded me that it isn’t about how you begin, but it’s about how you finish that matters. Despite a rocky start to my college experience, ISU gave me a chance and provided me with the resources and people to turn it around. I couldn’t imagine where I’d be without this school and all the students and faculty that make Iowa State, Iowa State. I certainly wouldn’t trade my experience and time here for anything; now, as a graduating senior, I couldn’t be more proud to say that I will be receiving my degree from Iowa State University.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">General Education Reflection</h3>
        <p>Throughout my general education experience, I have taken several classes that have expanded my knowledge beyond the technical aspects of engineering. These classes have allowed me to evaluate and formulate engineering solutions holistically, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental impacts of their implementation. In this essay, I will discuss my experience in three classes: SOC 220, ECON 101, and ARCH 321, and how they have helped me think beyond engineering solutions.<br><br>In SOC 220: Globalization and Sustainability, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the major global issues in sustainability, including the depletion of natural resources, climate change, and the unequal distribution of wealth and resources. Through this class, I learned about the interconnectedness of energy, materials, human resources, economics, and technology in creating sustainable systems. I also learned that sustainable engineering solutions must consider the economic, social, and environmental impacts of their implementation. This class emphasized the importance of collaboration between engineers, economists, and sociologists to create sustainable systems that benefit society as a whole.<br><br>In ECON 101: Principles of Microeconomics, I gained a fundamental understanding of economics and its impact on engineering solutions. This class taught me about resource allocation, opportunity cost, supply and demand, marginal analysis, pricing, and the present discounted value. I learned that engineers must evaluate the feasibility of their solutions' costs and their potential benefits in the long run. This class emphasized the importance of considering the economic impact of engineering solutions and the necessity of a cost-benefit analysis.<br><br>In ARCH 321: History of the American City, I learned about the development of the built environment and the urban condition in the United States from the colonial period to today. Through this class, I gained a better understanding of urban spatial organization, built form, technological change, regulatory and funding patterns, and social categories such as class, race, and gender. This class emphasized the importance of considering the social impact of engineering solutions and the necessity of accounting for social categories when designing solutions for urban environments. I also learned that the built environment is continually evolving, and engineers must consider historical, regulatory, and funding patterns when creating solutions.<br><br>In conclusion, my general education experience has provided me with a well-rounded education that extends beyond the technical aspects of engineering. Through classes like SOC 220, ECON 101, and ARCH 321, I have learned to evaluate and formulate engineering solutions that consider the economic, social, and environmental impacts of their implementation. These classes have emphasized the importance of collaboration between engineers and other professionals, including economists, sociologists, and historians. With this knowledge, I am better equipped to become a more comprehensive and knowledgeable engineer.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Ethics Paper</h3>
        <p>The world is a complex place filled with lots of mistreatment and wrongdoings, dilemmas, and problems that will constantly arise. There are so many scenarios that will cause you to question your own beliefs and make you rethink what you do and do not know to be right and wrong. It will challenge your way of life and what you believe to be true as the world is filled with many things that cannot be easily labeled as right or wrong, it’s a place clouded with gray area. It can be tricky to navigate without some set of guidelines to follow as you maneuver your way through the world. One should develop their own code of ethics to help guide them through life and its many obstacles and to help them determine between good and evil along the journey. Not just a professional code, but a personal one to help in all aspects of life that can still help manage their careers which is especially necessary in the field of cybersecurity. I believe that one should treat others as they wish to be treated, that they should remain honest and transparent with their decisions and the reasons behind them, maintain respect for those around you, stick to your beliefs and stand your ground, be accountable, and to be fair.<br><br>Treating other as you wish to be treated, I believe is a very noble standard to live by because it allows you to decide that you would be okay with someone else making, while it may not be perfect, I believe it is certainly in the right direction. In a career like cybersecurity where I could possess and control a lot of sensitive information, I would want someone responsible handling that knowledge and would hope they would act in my best interests, by sticking true to my treating others as I wish to be treated, I will act appropriately in taking care of this data. It will help to keep me in check of securing the data to the best of my ability and to ensure it is not being used at the expense of the user or customer. This also implies that I would stand up for the user when necessary if I were to discover that their information was being used/sold without their knowledge or consent and attempt to make it right or alert the consumer even at the expense of my own job as I would hope someone would do the same for me. I believe this trait to be a noble one that can apply to many situations from very serious ones to even minor more common workplace experiences. <br><br>When working in a team you always want to be hear everyone’s opinion no matter how quiet they may be. Helping someone speak up for themselves and ensuring that they are heard is something I would want someone to do for me, so I know that my opinion is valid and considered. Treating others as you wish to be treated also means that you would take great care and respect when addressing and dealing with your fellow coworkers and customers as you would expect so in return even if they are being rude. Not only does this rule apply to actions, but also in thought. Think of others as you would like to be thought of, never see someone as lesser than you, make everyone equal in your mind. Feel about others as you would want them to feel about you. And most certainly speak to other as you would want them to speak to you, don’t talk down to someone, speak to them as an equal and treat them as such. Don’t hold onto harsh feeling as it can cause resentment and disagreement in the workplace that can cause pitfalls and decreased efficiency. Treating and thinking of others as lesser can cause you to begin to lose remorse and feeling for those you work for and lead you to make unethical decisions on how you treat customers. You must acknowledge and understand the data you could potentially control and remember to keep it safe and protect it as your own. <br><br>A few soft skills that can help with this are simple things like communication and social skills. You want to be able to communicate yourself clearly and effectively and with the right tone and preciseness. Basic social skills will allow you even to communicate more effectively as well and work in a group without fault. But a place where I can struggle with these rules of treatment in the aspect of holding onto feelings. I tend to hold onto negative feeling and hold a grudge which can negatively impact how I treat others and work with them. This is certainly something I need to work on and work towards of thew ability of letting go of anger. I must learn to forgive but not forget to further master the ability to treat others as I wish to be treated. <br><br>To go along with treating others, I believe honesty and transparency is a key aspect necessary in all codes of ethics. While one can and should maintain privacy in their personal life, they should be open and honest about their professional life. Information about decisions and the logic behind the decision should be shared freely as to help understand and keep those responsible in check. A certain level of transparency in all decision-making processes and actions made by a company or individual helps to build trust between the maker and user of a product or service and allows for a relationship to form. Transparency helps me to focus more than just on “how much risk am I willing to take,” because these decisions could affect way more people than just me (L21 S18). This honesty helps with the former code of treating others as you wish to be treated because then the customer feels a sense of respect that you shared this information and that they are treated as an equal because they have a right to know how their information is handled/used. <br><br>The main soft skill that I believe applies to this is communication skills. You must be able to communicate what you are doing and how you are effectively while not giving too much away if there is sensitive information that must be kept secret. The area I struggle with most in this aspect is being honest to those who I feel the truth may hurt. As some say “the truth hurts” but that doesn’t mean I have to bear the truth on those who are not ready to hear it. However, this most likely won’t apply in a professional setting as the consumer would much rather know the truth about all our decision making and the logic behind it. The concept of transparency was the one most impacted by this class as I began to realize the true importance of it to build trust. <br><br>The next code that helps to maintain this level of honesty is respect. Having respect for those around you and who you work for allows you to treat them equally and realize that they deserve to know the truth. Treating others with respect also allows a more civil and professional atmosphere to arrive that can foster a productive environment where everyone is treated equally, and all opinions are heard. This also goes along with the rule of treating others as you wish to be treated because I would hope someone would be respectful towards me as well. <br><br>The two main soft skills that help with treating others with respect are communication and social skills. Once again applying to tone and how you handle other people will help you to treat them respectfully as well as respecting their opinions and ideas. However, there are a few more skills that apply to this indirectly such as time management and decision making. With time management you are showing respect to their schedule and needs as well as their own, it’s more than just respecting the person but also their time. Decision making can show respect depending on your choice, whether it means respecting their right to privacy and their wishes or choosing to ignore them or being hesitant in your choice. <br><br>The ability to stand up for myself I believe is vital for a career in cybersecurity where I can face many ethical dilemmas in my time. It allows me to never falter on my beliefs and to stand up for those around me as well or for those who cannot stand up for themselves. Standing up for myself also means I can stick to my other ethical codes that guide me rather than being pushed out of them and allowing myself to be manipulated. Self-confidence is by far the most important soft skill for this code as I must be sure of myself to stand my ground. I must remain true to myself and not let others try and convince me to do as I wouldn’t want other to. Although you must stand up for your beliefs you must understand that you“can respect another’s right to hold beliefs different from your own, without giving up your right to believe you’re right,” (L03 S21). <br><br>With all these decisions being made and contemplated I must also be accountable for my actions. This comes with transparency as well, but I must take ownership of what I do and admit when I made a mistake. If I make a flaw or cause a problem with consumers I must own up to my actions and admit a mistake was made so others are aware of the potential danger as a moral responsibility to those who put their trust in me. Leadership is a key soft skill that applies to this code because I must take responsibility and take ownership to fix my mistake and take the appropriate course of action to correct it and not sit back to let others fix what I did. Another skill that can help with this is the ability to hand pressure. In this career you “will have to defend decisions you make, even if only to yourself” and I cannot fold under the pressure of such an action (L03 S6). <br><br>I must also lose biases in my decision making so I can make a choice that benefits the majority and not what I believe in. Decision must be made in the best interest of those who are affected by them and not for my own personal gain. While arguable the latter would be more beneficial to my career, it would be morally wrong and go against what I believe in. And looping back to the first code of treating other as you wish to be treated, I would hope someone would take my best interests in mind when making a decision that impacts me. Since I “may even make decisions that impact the freedom or safety of others,” I must remain unbiased to my own needs (L03 S6). <br><br>I trust that one should deal with others as they want to be handled, that they must continue to be honest and transparent with their choices and the motives that drive them, respect those around you, stick to your beliefs and stand up for yourself, be accountable, and lose biases. This personal code of ethics will help guide me through life and allow me to make the best decisions in my career as a cybersecurity professional.</p>
